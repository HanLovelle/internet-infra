**Designing rough wireframe of home page**

Focusing this update on coding the main wireframe of the homepage to get an idea of the overall container placement that I'll be inserting text and images into.

I have also started looking at colour palettes to test out in relation to my design theme. I want to challenge myself in designing a dark themed website. The colour palettes that I have experimented for this update will mostly be in the blues. Using blues are inspired by the connection people have when thinking of tech and networks - in how we visualize the active electric charges from the cables and etc.
