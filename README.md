**Finalising Design**

I have added my images and text in this update. I have changed the wireframe of the starter code quite a bit so that the images could flow better with the overall layout. Challenges I have come accross are using margin, padding, and display. It has been a while since I have coded in html and css so I had to keep changing the numbers and variables so that it would all fit correctly. I have not used flex display before so that was interesting to try, and am hoping the code works and runs the same on other computers other than from my laptop. 

The four categories of information on internet infrastructure I have inserted are antennas, manhole covers, cameras, and other(spark telephone booth & bus stop schedule sign). I had to research information about these to ensure I was sharing the right information. All the photos I have taken are in the main Wellington city area.
